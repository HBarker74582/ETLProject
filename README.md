# ETLProject

We decided to use the LA Craigslist as our source for our information to extract from.
After gathering this information we used Jupyter Notebook to transform the information by filtering the data by item,price and URL link.

We inserted the data into a Mongo dataabase via Jupyter notebook Pandas.

We then used Flask to render the database into a HTML page where we presented the data to public via a HTML page.
